# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 31, 2026**

## Overview

MockFrame ("the App") is developed with privacy as a core principle. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information.

## Data Collection

**MockFrame does not collect any personal data.**

The App operates entirely on your device. No information is transmitted to external servers, and no analytics, tracking, or telemetry is implemented.

## Photo Library Access

MockFrame requests access to your photo library for the following purposes:

- **Read Access**: To import screenshots for mockup creation
- **Write Access**: To save completed mockups to your photo library

These permissions are required for core app functionality. Photos are processed locally on your device and are never uploaded, transmitted, or shared with any third party.

## Data Storage

All app data, including your preferences and any temporary files created during editing, is stored locally on your device. No cloud storage or synchronization is used.

## Third-Party Services

MockFrame does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Children's Privacy

MockFrame does not collect data from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, we will post the new policy on this page and update the "Last Updated" date.
