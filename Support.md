# MockFrame Support

## Getting Started

MockFrame helps you create professional device mockups for App Store screenshots, design presentations, and portfolio showcases.

### Basic Workflow

1. **Import**: Tap to import a screenshot from your photo library
2. **Select**: Use the precision grid overlay to select your desired region
3. **Customize**: Adjust status bar elements (battery, time, signal, carrier)
4. **Export**: Save your high-resolution mockup to your photo library

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I import an image?

Tap the import button and select a screenshot from your photo library. MockFrame will request photo library access on first use.

### How do I select a region?

Use the grid overlay to define the exact area you want to include in your mockup. Drag to select and adjust the selection handles for precision.

### What export formats are available?

MockFrame supports JPEG and PNG export formats, both at high resolution suitable for App Store submissions.

### Why does MockFrame need photo library access?

MockFrame requires read access to import your screenshots and write access to save completed mockups. All processing happens locally on your device.

### Does MockFrame work offline?

Yes. MockFrame processes all images locally on your device and does not require an internet connection.

### What is the maximum image size supported?

MockFrame supports images up to 5000x5000 pixels or 12 megapixels. Larger images are automatically downscaled for optimal performance.

## Troubleshooting

### App crashes when importing large images

MockFrame automatically manages memory for large images. If you experience issues:
- Close other apps to free up memory
- Try importing a smaller resolution image
- Restart the app

### Exported image quality is low

Ensure you're selecting PNG format for maximum quality. JPEG compression may reduce quality slightly.

### Photo library permission denied

1. Open **Settings** on your device
2. Navigate to **Privacy & Security** > **Photos**
3. Find **MockFrame** and select **Full Access**
